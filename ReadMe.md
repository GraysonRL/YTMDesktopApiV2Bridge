# YTMDesktopApiV2Bridge
## An unfinished bridge between requests to [YTMDesktop](https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop)'s V2 Api and th-ch's [Youtube-Music](https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music) API

!! This is largely unfinished !!
The only functionality currently added is accepting authorization requests from attempted connections (in a rather insecure way as well). 
The current TODO is as remains:
- Implement YTMDesktop's websocket (highest priority)
- Implement the rest of YTMDesktop's functionality
- Connect these requests to th-ch's Youtube-Music
- Possibly create a plugin for th-ch's Youtube-Music that allows for this script to either be autorun on boot, or naitively run through TS/JS (unlikely)
